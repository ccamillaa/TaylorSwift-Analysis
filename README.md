When I had the opportunity to join my Swiftie passion and a university project I jumped at the occasion, and this is the result! This is an individual project for the *Social Media and Web Analytics* course of my Master Degree in Data Analytics at Ca' Foscari University of Venice.

Swift's songwriting, often likened to a personal diary, intimately chronicles her life experiences from adolescence to international stardom. This thematic continuity shows her growth from an unknown high schooler to a cultural icon, in a one of a kind coming-of-age style journey. This analysis of her discography seeks to highlight the stylistic shifts and thematic patterns that have defined her career, assessing whether her songwriting has undergone evolution over time. 

The analysis is divided into two parts:
- The first one, delves into statistics related to the general characteristics of the songs, analysing some measures that Spotify calculates for each track. The dataset was published on **[Kaggle by Jarred Priester](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jarredpriester/taylor-swift-spotify-dataset/code)** and uses Spotify’s API to collect information about every Taylor Swift album on Spotify. This dataset updates monthly, so the version currently available at the linked Kaggle page may differ from the one that I worked with for this project.
- The second part of the analysis leverages the lyrics of all Taylor's studio albums' songs to study how her songwriting style and topics changed through time. The lyrics were published in .txt format on **[Kaggle by Ishika Johari](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishikajohari/taylor-swift-all-lyrics-30-albums)**, and they were collected using Genius Lyrics’ API.
 
At the time of the project, the lastest album was *Midnights* and the latest Taylor's Version was *Speak Now*.
