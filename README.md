# TaylorSwift-Analysis
Swift's songwriting, often likened to a personal diary, intimately chronicles her life experiences from adolescence to international stardom. This thematic continuity shows her growth from an unknown high schooler to a cultural icon, in a one of a kind coming-of-age style journey. This analysis of her discography seeks to highlight the stylistic shifts and thematic patterns that have defined her career, assessing whether her songwriting has undergone evolution over time. 

This is an individual project for the Social Media and Web Analytics course of my Master Degree is Data Analytics at Ca' Foscari University of Venice.
